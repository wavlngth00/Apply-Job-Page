# Apply Job Page

## 📝 Project Overview
**Apply Job Page** is a simple and clean web page designed for online job applications.  
Users can view available job listings on the main page (`index.html`), fill out the application form on the `applyform.html` page, and after submission, they are redirected to `success.html` as a confirmation page.

The project structure is organized for easy understanding and future development.  
The `css` folder contains the stylesheet, `js` stores JavaScript files for interactivity, and `img` holds all image assets.
